# Arellano University Research Portal

A research portal is a digital platform or website that provides centralized access to a range of research resources, such as academic journals, articles, conference proceedings, books, and other scholarly materials. Research portals are designed to help researchers, academics, students, and other users to easily search, discover, access, and share information related to their specific areas of interest.

Research portals can be either public or private, with some portals requiring users to register and pay a fee for access to premium content. Some popular research portals include Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, JSTOR, and PubMed, among others.
